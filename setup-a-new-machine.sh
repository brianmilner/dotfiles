# my magic photobooth symlink -> dropbox. I love it.
#  + first move Photo Booth folder out of Pictures
#  + then start Photo Booth. It'll ask where to put the library.

# * Nowâ€¦ you can record photobooth videos quickly and they upload to dropbox DURING RECORDING
# * then you grab public URL and send off your video message in a heartbeat.
